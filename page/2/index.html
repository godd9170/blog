<p>
    This past weekend I had the pleasure of participating in <a href="http://www.waterloohacks.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waterloo hacks</a>. It boasted an impressive list of sponsors including Manulife, OpenText, SAP and Google. (They didn't disappoint in the swag department either!)
</p>

<p>
    This was my first hackathon, and it made me wish I had done more throughout University. Unfortunately I seemed to be too preoccupied in my younger days with partying just down the road at WLU. 
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, I spent about 40 of the allotted 48 hours conscious and at my macbook hammering away at our <em>hack</em>. While some sponsors offered some guidance on what your hack should entail, in order to qualify for their prize, there was <strong>absolutely no guidance</strong> otherwise. What a concept. Here's all the food, resources and talent you could ever need, now do <strong>whatever it is that you'd like!</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
    My team landed on an iOS app, that allowed users to log moment in their life with nothing more than a picture, a quick optional note and a ranking of their happiness. A virtual journal if you will. The app will then pull data at the time of the photo such as the weather, the billboard charts and the stock market performance and allow the user to re-live that particular snapshot in their travels. The name? <em>Rearview</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The idea was that if you are constantly keeping an unbiased log of your mental state, you could begin to correlate things in your life that affect your mood for better or for worse.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve this, we landed on using React Native, and Django on the server side. We were all excited to explore the hype around Facebook's new mobile technology, and what better way to do so. Here is how it turned out:
</p>
<div class="slider">
    <ul>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/1.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/2.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/3.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/4.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/5.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/6.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/7.jpg" style="height: 400px;"></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    I felt we had a strong product, however we weren't one of the 10 teams invited to pitch our product in the finals. While I'm certainly biased, I felt the contest was more about ambitious innovations and less about execution of a working hack.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the short-falling, I'm proud of what our small team was able to accomplish. None of us had even so much as opened Xcode before, yet here was a fully functional iOS app out the door in a mere 48 hours. I suppose the real prize was not the $750 in tech gadgets of the winning teams' choosing, but rather the skills you'll pad onto your resume.

<p>
Way back in Mrs. Affleck's grade twelve calculus class I met this wide-grinned German fellow.
</p>

<img src="/images/germany/hankon.jpg">

<p>
It's rare that you find anyone of any origins other than Prince Edward County at my alma matter PECI. Yet here was Konstantine, who found his was there through his Aunt, and was spending the entire year immersed in rural Canadian culture.
</p>

<p>
He's since visited Canada a number of times, and even participated in a 3 week European trip with myself and some friends back in 2013. Each of his excursions would end with an invitation for us to visit his home in Munich Germany. Well it was time I took him up on that.
</p>

<p>
I'd booked my flights home from Romania such that I'd allow for 4 days in München. There was plenty of sites to be seen, however the first order of business was to enjoy a bottle of quality Deutsch Lager and catch up with my Bavarian Buddy.
</p>

<p>
We took a walking tour of the city and in this case, pictures say much more than I could possibly express.
</p>

<div class="slider">
    <ul>
        <li><img src="/images/germany/siewerden.jpg"></li>
        <li><img src="/images/germany/church.jpg"></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
The trip wouldn't be complete however with a drive on the Autobahn. Part of Kon's weekend plans had us commuting 3 hours north (which would be 4 if we had to travel at Canadian speeds) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coburg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coburg</a> where we'd celebrate his friend's 22nd birthday. If traffic is heavy (which it was on our departure) the highway does post a maximum speed of a magnitude relative to the vehicle density. 100km/h was in place, which for the sole Canadian party in the vehicle, seemed entirely reasonable. Then after about a half hour or so of <em>sluggish</em> travel we ramped up to a hefty 180km/h cruising velocity. At first I gripped my passenger assist handle like a louisville slugger, but as we, and those around us continued at this pace, only the speedometer would indicate we were moving at a rate substantially faster than the 119km/h I'm accustomed to.
</p>

<p>
For the birthday boy's special day we were treated to a traditional bavarian spread. It consisted of cured meats, various egg based spreads, and plenty of whole grain breads to create your own open faced sandwiches. Of course none of this would be complete without ice cold beer served from a wooden keg. A keg tapped by actually hammering a metal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_(valve)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spigot</a> into it! Does it get more German than that?
</p>

<p>
The theme of the excursion was certainly Beer. As such, this blog post seems to be lacking a few details. The evening following the dinner had us traversing the small town to a party of about 30 or so. Plenty of energy drink infused beverages results in an extremely foggy conclusion to the evening.
</p>

<p>
A final schnitzel dinner, a 7am boarding and I bid Konsty Auf Wiedersehen.

<p>
One of my favourite bars in Bucharest, or anywhere for that matter, is <a href="http://www.oktoberfest-pub.ro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oktoberfest</a>. There are a few in town, and some don neon lights twisted such that they spell out 'Non-Stop'. I haven't translated that to pander to you fair english speaking reader - 'Non-Stop' is precisely how it reads. What they are communicating with electronically excited noble gas tubes is that their fine establishment does not close. Should you ever feel the need for a 7am beer on a Sunday Morning, Oktoberfest has your back.
</p>

<p>
The extensive hours of operation however, are not the reason for the metaphorical tip of my hat. Oktoberfest has my recommendation for one particular offering - The Metre. A plank of wood, approximately 1m in length (I'm pretty sure this is the origin of the name) with circular depressions equally spaced along it. Each depression has a notch where the circle becomes tangential with the edge. 8 mugs of beer are then slotted into each depression, with the handle secured in the notch, and served as one big party pack boasting 3.2L of beer. 
</p>

<p>
Have you ever split a pitcher of beer with some acquaintances, in the pursuit of a more economical evening? The contents of which quickly disappears, then without hesitation a server prompts, "Another pitcher?" All parties cease conversation and offer a look consisting of a suggestive eyebrow raise to one another. Finally a leader emerges and confirms the lingering service worker's inquiry with an almost defeated "...yeah sure." All economy has now gone by the wayside and what was supposed to be an in-and-out social beverage has become a regretful Wednesday morning.
</p>

<p>
Well, the same anomaly exists at Oktoberfest tenfold. I once witnessed a table full of 6 Football hooligans demolish upwards of 5 planks. This gave me an idea. My time in Romania was drawing to a close and my colleagues wanted to know how I'd like to conclude my foray. Thus, the metre challenge was born.
</p>

<img src="/images/competitors.jpg">
<caption><em>Left to Right: </em>Your's truly, Iulius, Costin</caption>

<p>
Quite simple really, each man must consume a metre. It is a race, and vomiting within 1 hour of consumption will disqualify you.
</p>

<p>
I came out of the gate pretty hot and consumed my first 0.4L glass well within a minute. A strategy I'd not recommend. I maintained the lead until about pint four where we established a tie. I was slowing my pace whilst my peers increasing. Pint 5 was the hardest, and pint 7 the easiest, and seemed to depend on how much I was thinking about the volume I'd yet to consume. The more I acknowledged the beverage in front of me, the more my stomach loathed the idea of additional lager. 
</p>

<p>
The last beer is where it got interesting. With all three competitors reaching for the final mug synchronously, it was silently established that the men were about to be separately identified from the boys. I knew that chugging would result in an a re-introduction of my stomach contents to the plank, so I took it easy. Iulius was evidently labouring with his ultimate glass, while Costin almost seemed to forget it was a competition. I could see no evidence of struggle in the man's eyes and he effortlessly poured the entirety of #8 to the depths of his stomach. Seeing that rate of consumption nearly caused a gastric eruption of my own. He had done it. Costin was crowned the metre challenge champion, while Iulius violated the only disqualification clause all over some poor soul in the unlit bathroom.

      Part of the joy of living with locals while travelling is that you can embark on weekend long roadtrips with no need to plan. I discovered this as Bogdan, Iulius and I set sail on Halloween Saturday morning with some long coffees and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Dacia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dacia</a> full of gas. Beyond the direction we were headed being North, I was completely unbeknownst as to what the trip had in store, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

    <p>
      Sighișoara is gorgeous. It's one of the only inhabited fortified citadels in Europe, and it's been well taken care of. In the middle of the town is a big assed clock tower that you can (for a small fee) still access the top of. Here's the unreal view from it, and supporting evidence of my 'gorgeous' claim. 
    </p>
    <img src="/images/romtrip/sigi.jpg">

      We spent the night here at a BnB owned probably the most overwhelmingly friendly people I've met. After checking in we given a shot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pálinka</a> (which sends shivers down your spine its so strong) and shown our rooms. While making some plans for the night with my travelling companions, a knock on our door yielded a complimentary bottle of wine from our hostesses to welcome me to Romania.

      Best part of Sighi? The breakfast we had Sunday morning. The only thing more beautiful than the view was our waitress. Check out this place:

    <span class="location-header">Castle Bran</span>
    <p>
      I'm told the celebration of Halloween is rather new in Europe, and costumes seem to be much less elobroate than that of 'go-hard' Western norms. Perhaps it's appropriate then, that our first stop on the journey was non other than Dracula's castle.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/romtrip/bran.jpg">
    <p>
     'Castle Bran' as they insisted on calling it despite my objection, is quite the sight. It's converted into a museum that offers a slew of information both on the history of the Castle and the origins of Bram Stoker's novel. None of this I read, as I was too busy trying to craft witty Snapchats and insisting to my co-travellers that dracula still resided here. Key takeaway? Iulius is actually Vlad the Impaler's (the Ruler whom Dracula is believed to be based on) great-great-great-grandson.

  <!--Viscri-->
  <span id="visci" style="display: none;">
    <span class="location-header">Viscri</span>
    <p>
      Viscri is a tiny little town, and to my point earlier would likely never have been on the itinerary had I not been accompanied by native Romanians. It has a fortified church in its centre and for an even more modest fee than the tower in Sighișoara you can climb to its apex. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This leg of the journey I was handed the keys to Iulius' white Dacia - and I was pretty pumped. Driving in rural Romania is a lot like Prince Edward County, except even more potholes, and farmers aren't as concerned about their livestock wandering across roads.

  <!--Rupea-->
  <span id="rupea" style="display: none;">
    <span class="location-header">Rupea</span>
    <p>
      The theme of the trip seemed to be citadels, as we stopped in Rupea to view yet another relic of medieval Romania. The fort has a spiral path up to the top, where I elected to ruin all of the majesty by performing the childish obsession of my generation.

  <!--Brasov-->
  <span id="bras" style="display: none;">
    <span class="location-header">Brașov</span>
    <p>
      Brașov is where I learned that 'ș' makes a 'shh' sound. I also learned what the hell a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCrt%C5%91skal%C3%A1cs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kürtőskalács</a> is. It's a delicious baked ring of dough that is coated in sugar. It turns out that butter sugar and flour are tasty no matter where you go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also pretty amused to see a familar concept located up in the hills overlooking the city of 200,000+.

    <span class="location-header">Bucharest</span>
    <p>
      This has been my home for the last month. By far largest city in Romania (over 2 million) and certainly no shortage of old world beauty. I've talked enough about the city in blogs past, but here is a picture of the stone eagle, perched atop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_National_Military_Circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cercul Militar Național</a> that peers into my room from across the street each morning.

    Have you ever had a long conversation with no general purpose, eventually reaching a topic that has everyone questioning, "How the hell did we start talking about this?" The discussion began with last night's party and ended up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_European_cuisine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early modern European cuisine</a>? Then everyone tries to retrace their verbal steps back to the original dialogue?
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps you've spent far too long on Wikipedia recursively clicking links and reading articles in order to properly understand the previous article. It really is amazing how what seems to be two completely separate ideas are in fact related in one or two degrees of common topics. 
</p>
<p> 
    What's that? You've haven't experienced either of these scenarios? Well that's alright because this post thus far has just been a philosophical segway into this anyways:
</p>
    <div class="wiki-button-container">
        <a class="wiki-button" href="http://wiki.henrygoddard.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wiki-Game</a>
        <div style="font-size: 10px;color: #4a4a4a;">(This only works on a computer, sorry mobile friends)</div>
    </div>

<p>
    That button will take you to a little app I whipped up that simulates what I was alluding to above. So you can experience what I was talking about without the need for friends! 
</p>
<p>
    So here's the deal. You get two completely unrelated Wikipedia article topics. You are then presented with all the links that can be found in the first article. When you click a link, you'll be brought all of that page's links. It's your job to strategically select links until you've reached the second article. You can hover your mouse over the title of the second article to get a brief summary of it so you're not completely in the dark. 
</p>
<p>
    You'll be greeted by a loading screen that cycles through the random Wikipedia topics. It's looking for a desitination article with a minimum of 300 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlinks</a>. I know I began this post talking about the magical interconnectivity of human knowledge, and how everything eventually relates to something else... but sometimes the topic is so goddamn obscure you haven't a hope in hell of finding it. So, sit tight and wait for a 'do-able' destination article (the game will automatically begin once one is found) or if you wanna be a hero you can click the <em>'F*@$ it I'll do this one'</em> button and you'll start a game with the articles that are presented at the time of your click. 
</p>
<p>
    I wish I could say this is an original idea. I honestly thought of it by myself, but it would seem I'm not the first to create such an app. These guys <a href="http://thewikigame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> have made quite the little business out of it. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy my little side project!

While grocery shopping this past week, I stumbled upon a deal that was too good to be true. For the extremely reasonable price of 3.18 Lei, one could take home 2L of 3% Blond Lager. There absolutely had to be a catch. So in the name of science, I conducted an investigation.

As I write this I'm drinking the remainder of the bottle, and have yet to notice a buzz. This might be the catch. I'm confident that putting a few of these less than stellar brown plastics back will eventually yield some intoxication, however therein lies the problem. For just cents more you can get into some much tastier, higher proof brews like Ursus, Ciuc or Timișoara. Maybe there is a moral in here somewhere...

  One late Saturday evening after a night in rural Holland, I found myself watching a Woodstock Documentary with my new Dutch friend, William. He was a huge fan of all things Woodstock, and had even visited where it took place. He'd taken two separate road trips across continental US and constructed some marvelous scrap books filled with pictures, time relevant billboard charts and various tokens such as receipts and coasters. He knew the owner of the bar we visited (which happened to be hosting a volunteer firefighter party), and was able to teach me how to properly pour a Heineken.

After sampling much of which there is to <em>legally sample</em> in the Netherlands, and feeling that the night was drawing to an end, we gathered around William's living room for a viewing of his favourite documentary - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066580/?ref_=ttalt_alt_tt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Woodstock</a>.
</p>

<p> I barely remember the narrative that was provided by my well-traveled host, however I do remeber the strong degree of passion with which he spoke of it. I awoke the next day with this in my digital notepad: </p>

<p>
That man is in his element. I wish I knew more of why I decided to write that, and I like to think that I meant 'be that guy' in the figurative sense. That guy can seize a moment. I'm guilty of listening to the nagging voice in the back of my head that questions how the particular activity I'm partaking in can be better. 'If only I had ______'. Well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_de_la_Parra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adolfo de la Parra</a> doesn't wonder that. Adolfo de la Parra owns every millisecond of that performance, and I want to make that type of mentailty much more common place in my life.

  It's been a while since I've revealed the contents of my iPhone notepad to the world, but alas here is yet another textual glimpse inside my brain. This one comes from a cab ride I took with some friends to a housewarming party at a new apartment in Bucharest. 
</p>
<p>
I quite enjoy the banter that invariably evokes itself between cab drivers (and uber drivers for that matter) and cab clientele. It's as though the your friend group, who typically share a relatively common ideology now have a temporary external viewpoint drop in. A common topic, Politics.
</p>

      "Taxi cab political conversations are the more elaborate."
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
 Bucharest is undergoing a time of significant political change, and seems to be the topic of most people's conversations. While I couldn't understand what the man behind the wheel was saying, it was clear that all parties involved spoke with passion. It reminded me of plenty of cases I'd found myself in various Ubers and cabs over the last few years. Being that I was merely and observer in this exchange, I was able to jot down my micro-epiphany.
</p>

<p>
  I suppose I'm not the first to recognize the escalation of driver-passenger commentary, HBO released <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taxi-Cab Confessions</a> in 1995, which highlighted this exact feat. There is something about the scenario, that makes it unlike other any other dialogue with strangers. Perhaps it's the mutual understanding that prolonged silence is more painful than some chatter, perhaps it's the lack of eye contact should you be seated immediately behind the operator. I don't know, but I do know that I love me some good taxi-cab discourse.
</p>
 If not politics, sometimes topics of great empathy can emerge. I had a rather teary eyed ride on my way to the Seattle-Tacoma airport with a man who lost his mother due to brain cancer. We had a very common experience and it took us from strangers to pseudo brothers over the duration of the 20 minute journey. While full of pain, there was something really satisfying about the experience. It was as though I wanted a ride, and got a therapy session. Forget <a href="http://ubereats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UberEats</a> try <strong>UberFreuds</strong>.
 <p></p>
 <p>
  I suppose the therapy of speaking candidly to a stranger is a two-way street. I read a tweet from a New Yorker who had a bit of a reversed experience, where he offered some solidarity to a victim of islamaphobia in the wake of Friday's events. 
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My cab ride home, was the saddest moment I&#39;ve experienced as apart of the human race. Please, stop generalizing ppl <a href="https://t.co/O8PdtJlYCO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/O8PdtJlYCO</a></p>&mdash; Alex (@alexmalloyy) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmalloyy/status/665391353556242432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>
 I guess if there is anything to take from this, next time you need some human interaction, a second opinion on something or a just a shoulder to cry on - hop in a cab.
