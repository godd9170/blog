  This Sunday's <strong>iPhone Thought</strong>'s exact place of origin has unfortunately been lost. Likely due to the topic it is discussing. It is yet another product of 1am, which seems to be a pretty common time for these.

<p>
  On the surface, that seems like a frat inspired, keg standing, go-hard comment, and it likely is, but I'm going to take a run at deriving some more meaning from it. Perhaps this is a metaphor for experiences in general. Swap 'beers you drank' with 'new experiences you've had' and we've got ourselves a anecdote worth sharing. Overwhelm yourself with positivity, and soon your life will become so filled with hapiness, that you can't put a number to the joyous occasions.

  I've got a weird habit of writing iPhone notes containing ideas that pop into my head. Not so much ideas as they are interesting thoughts, typically brought on by the influence of social consumption. Every so often a completely 'organic' tidbit gets recorded, but there is definitely something about a few beers that can really bring on the creativity.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps I'm alone, but oftentimes a wave of clarity consumes my thoughts, and the only thing I focus on is constructing a sentence or two that perfectly encapsulates the thesis of my brief dance with enlightenment. I think the only reason I do it, is because I feel some closure knowing that the idea produced during these rare moments can be revisited later.
</p>
<p>
  The notes vary from attempts at profoundness, to business ventures, to indecipherable pointless jabber. Nonetheless I thought it would be fun to explore one each Sunday. And so, I present to you, noble audience of what I presume to be three or four; <strong>'iPhone Note Sundays'</strong>.

      "Not worrying about tailoring your behaviour (within reason) so not to offend anyone around you, is arguably the best part of hanging out with your friends."
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Finding myself at more social business events, I've learned it's actually rather tiring maintaining an appropriate level of engagement in topics that aren't necessarily of interest. Furthermore consciously 'tailoring you behaviour' definitely takes away from the enjoyment that boundaryless conversation has.
</p>
<p>
 To go a layer deeper, one could even argue that more beneficial topics are addressed, and more creative solutions generated when there isn't an overarching fear of offending the other party. When you're comfortable that the ‘discussee' knows you and your morals, and that a bold statement made by yourself won't shape how they view you as a whole, it makes for much more mutually beneficial dialogue.

I'm currently seeking a place of residence for the next year. I spent the entirety of my childhood in the same home, and the idea of moving used to conjure feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Four moves in five years later I'm functionally a nomad.
</p>
<p>
About two years ago I took a hand at writing my own posting in order help my roommate sublet his room for the four months he spent out of town on co-op. To this date it's my most 'liked' Facebook update and in rather egotistical fashion, I thought it would read nicely on my blog. Here it is:
</p>
</div>
<div class="snippet">
<span class="snippet-title"> Roomate Wanted </span>
<p>
Whatever you do, do not pay Jarrod Keogh his absurdly low rate of $300/month to sublet his room at 43 Hickory Street West for the upcoming winter semester. Trust me, I've been here for 2 years. Yeah fine, sure it can either be furnished or unfurnished, which is extremely convenient, and fine it does boast a full office filing cabinet... But does it have a hot tub? No. He's going to try and tell you that Ryan Gosling once slept in there, (which is only partially true) and that your proximity to the router means unparalleled 100mbps download... But He's half Dutch so take your chances. It will be probably a week or two before your closet stops smelling like Jarrod (which is like wood chips and regular gasoline). Realistically you would get a spot to park your car.. Actually there is room for two if you are in need... Jesus... I just popped my head out there you could probably fit a school bus if you wanted.
</p>
<p>
Anyways more to my point, your new neighbours will be a real pain. I know that they're 94 and 95 but they only occasionally wave when they're off to what we assume to be medical appointments and funerals of their friends. And forget expecting them to RSVP your event... I've left them off the list of our most recent 1am dub step keg related parties as they haven't even been to one! Instead they have the audacity to sit inside and never contact the authority's with noise complaints when it is completely within their rights to do so. I hope you're also a professional runner! it's a staggering 2 block walk to Laurier (3 technically if your are science building bound) which is not for the faint of heart.
</p>
<p>
I hope you don't have ADD, because other than the 6TB of movies on our local intranet, our 300gb/mo download cap, cable tv, 6 video game consoles, blue ray library and both beer pong tables it's like god damn solitary confinement up in here.
</p>
<p>
I trust you'll make the right choice. God forbid this is your last option and you do sign, at least I'll be there. We'll be like John Savage and Robert De Niro in The Deer Hunter. I trust you'll make the right decision.

          <p>I never understood surfing. I’m not dismissing it, I never claimed it to be an easy art, nor do I think it’s not appealing, I’m merely saying I truly didn’t understand it. I’d put some time in on a wakeboard in the past, and I suppose I assumed it to be a similar sensation. I was quite wrong.</p>
<p>Was a fine May sunday on the Oregon coast where I procured a wetsuit and a sturdy 8ft board from a quaint little surf shop. Flash forward an hour and I find myself straddling my new aquatic wave platform roughly 30ft from shore bobbing up and down in shoulder height rollers.<br>I took lead from my longtime friend who had recently caught the surfing bug and hence my enrolment in the Sunday activity. He yelled over the crashes of water on water, briefing me on the paddling technique required to attach oneself to a beachgoing sea vibration. “Lay stomach down towards the beach, paddle hard, when a wave comes, paddle harder, and when you’re in the wave paddle even harder.” With no intentions of letting him down I did just that. Then it happened.<br>A few previous attempts had me fall behind the wave, but not this time. I was consumed, and my pace matched that of my new fluid transport. Almost like an adopted child, I had been accepted. An immediate realization came flooding in. I get it. Surfing is about harnessing nature, latching onto the tremendous energy of the ocean and caring about that and only that, for a few exhilerating moments.<br>Yeah sure I didn’t actually quite stand up, but I felt it. I’ve still much to learn, and I look forward to my next oceanic encounter.</p>
