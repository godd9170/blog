          <p>Today was a first. I found myself mixed into an enormous protest in the streets of Bucharest Romania. What I thought at first was to be a vigil for the fallen of a recent tragedy, turned out to be the culmination of years of political friction.</p>
<p>Let me explain the situation as I understand it from having been here for just over a week (apologies to any Romanian readers if I’m off). On October 20th, a policeman clearing the road for Romania’s Interior Minister, Gabriel Oprea’s motorcade, was killed when his speeding bike hit a pothole. Citizens are already upset with some of the inherent corruption that exists within the standing government, their overuse of motorcades just one of the examples. The people demanded Oprea step down, and not only did he ignore them, he refused to comment on the policeman’s death, and said he wasn’t even aware of the man’s death 6 days after. Not a good dude.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last Friday (the 30th of October), and tragedy strikes <em>Club Colectiv</em>. A fire caused by pyrotechnic effect sparks ignited the foam soundproofing that covered the walls. <em>Colectiv</em> was a retro-fit decomishioned shoe factory packed with 400 people enjoying the launch of local band <em>Goodbye to Gravity</em>‘s new album. With only one exit, panic ensued killing 31 and severly injuring as much as 180. </p>
<p>This could not have come at a worse time. Over the weekend, the people’s sadness grew to anger. Now tonight the 3rd of November I find myself watching people marching sidewalk to side walk through the streets chanting for the resignition of Mr. Oprea.</p>
<p>Hailing from a rural portion of Canada, I’ve been sheltered from comparable demonstrations at home. Civil unrest such as the riots following the Vancouver Stanley Cup loss of 2011, or the 2012 Quebec student protests for example happened far from peaceful Prince Edward County. In a strictly educational way, I wish I were present during them in order to have some baseline by which to compare what I’ve experienced here. </p>
<p>I could feel the ground shaking from the rythmic hopping accompanying cries of resignation. Their syncronized roars of distaste reverberating between the grand stone buildings common to Bucharest’s core. While I was unable to understand the language being used, it was almost not neccesary as the tone that carried it spoke enough. Apart from some minor pushing where the police barrier met the crowd, no violence was shown. </p>

          <p>I departed from my apartment in pursuit of the gym I had signed up for the day prior, on a mission. I was going to operate in Bucharest like I lived there - which I suppose I do. As I pressed my way to the streets, the sour air of the city poured into my nose immediately after my eyes were greeted with the immersive view of european masonry. Bucharest is a beautiful sight in the morning. The people of which, are quite friendly, and as such quite commonly initiate conversation. To mitigate the awkward realization I have no idea what they are saying, I firmly inserted my white apple earbuds and was on my way.</p>
<p>A 15 minute walk had me to the top floor of the ‘Unirea Shopping Center’ where I found my gym - Salsafit. Since I had already procured a membership with the aid of my good local friend Bogdan, I was hopeful my absence of language would not interfer. I approached the front desk and offered the entirety of my Romanian vocabulary, ‘Salut’. It was met with a quickly paced sentence and a smile. Part of me was happy I’d been able to create the rouse that I was indeed a fully functioning citizen of Bucharest, the other half searching for how to effectively respond. “I’m afraid I don–”. She interupted, “No problem sir! How are you?”. The attendant could speak fluent English. I shouldn’t have been surprised, many people who I’ve had the pleasure of meeting here can too. </p>
<p>After a mediocre 45 minute pump session, I hit the showers. I tossed my coat on top of the locker and a post exercise wave of vitality combined with an intrinsic proudness to be independently functioning in a foreign city washed over me. I was meeting my objective, I am european, I am…shit. My coat had fallen behind the lockers and was completely unreachable. I can barely ask someone’s name let alone how to ‘retrieve my coat from behind the lockers’. So I tried to be a hero and place the bench up against the locker and reach over. My plan was falling short as I needed an additional 4 feet of reach. Naturally, I stepped into the top locker - SNAP! I had taken a large chunk out of Salsafit’s particle board shelving unit. I defy someone to casually rebound from that position. Fortunately no-one was around so I leapt to the floor, returned the bench and locked the structurally compromised locker shut. What chip?</p>
<p>Plan B. The next euro-lifter to enter the change room was going to be the answer to all my problems. “Can you speak english?”. “I am able to speak a little bit of English, yes.” he modestly proclaimed. Score! 2/2 on spoken encounters today. I have noticed a trend at this point, Romanians younger than 30 tend to be able speak english. I explain my dilemma to my new friend and together we begin to muscle the shelving unit away from the wall. After about 10 inches of opening I am able to catch a glimpse of my coat, its charcoal grey blending with the thick layer of dust. Littered amongst the forgotten wasteland that we’ve uncovered are roughly 20 spent steroid syringes, fortunately none seem to be poking into my jacket. Alexe (I never actually asked his name but that’s what I’m calling him) finds this awfully perturbing, and proceeds to alert the staff. The good people at Salsafit are embarrassed to say the least, and profusely apologize to me. I may have neglected to mention the chip in the locker, but hey… today is about fitting in.</p>

  <p>
    Each year my father, brother and myself embark on a trip to a new MLB stadium to enjoy America's favourite passtime. We'd managed to hit the majority of the AL East and a number of others. As it stands we've made it to the following parks shown below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is for my brother and myself to check of the remaining parks, hopefully one day with boys of our own. I'll continue to update this as we visit more.

          <p>Perspective is a funny thing. How can you properly understand another’s viewpoint on something, without having been exposed to the identical series of visions and experiences. I certainly believe that it’s healthy to challenge opinions and provide insight from another collection of observational wisdom. However it’s up to the brain behind the eyes doing the observing to form an ultimate conclusion. No two sentient minds will ever hold and identical neural database of belief, opinion, knowledge … and isn’t that a wonderful thing. For it’s the things that people create based on their perspectives that make this such an interesting world to have a perspective in.</p>

I was hesitant to post this, however I decided that despite the overbearing grief it fostered, it was one of the prouder moments in my life. The speech was a bit different than this, as I had worked from bullet points the day of. Below you'll find my best attempt at re-constructing what was actually delivered. 
</p>

<div class="snippet">
<span class="snippet-title">Eulogy</span>

<p>
I think a father's greatest duty, is to pass along the wisdom he's collected through life to his offspring. I also think that wisdom is a little more applicable to Sons rather than daughters, and fortunately for Jeffy, He's got 2. So I'd like to take this opportunity to share what I've learned from the old man and I hope everyone here can derive some benefit from it.
</p>

Here we go:

<ol>
  <li> "Eat until you are no longer hungry, not until you are full." <br>
    He would usually follow that up with: <br>
    "I've never been able to do it, but that's my advice"
  </li>

  <li>"Brussel sprouts are good and good for ya"</li>

  <li>"Eat your porridge it'll stick to your ribs"</li>

  <li>"Before you date a girl, make sure you meet her mother"</li>

  <li>"There are only 2 things that smell like fish, and one of them is fish"</li>
</ol>

<p>
However the best piece of advice, was never communicated to me via some cheeky one liner, but rather just an observation I've made being around my father. To keep my theme of singled sentenced wisdom doses going I've taken a stab at condesing it. And there is certainly a more elegant phrasing of this last piece, but it essentially all boils down to 'Just give a shit'. 
</p>

<p>
'Just give a shit', in every daily encounter you find yourself in, allow yourself to offer a minute piece of interest in someone else's life. People really resonate well when spoken to with some enthusiam and general regard for their current pursuits.
</p>

<p>
'Just giving a shit', is how you procure the boat load of dedicated lifelong friends Dad has all over the planet. Friendship was something extremely important to Jeff and he had a knack for recognizing strong character in people. It's a common theme for these folks, now couples, from out of town to spend the weekend at our house. Not one of these guests has ever  Establishing a mutual repect, and long term repor with people who would have otherwise never been associated had it not been for that initial outgoing nature and genuine kindness. 
</p>

<p>
I didn't think it was possible to properly put a label on the type of person my father was. It didn't seem possible that one word could encapsulate the legacy. However I was able to find a definition that came pretty close:
</p>

<p>
/men(t)SH/
  <em>
  "someone to admire and emulate, someone of noble character. The key to being 'a real mensch' is nothing less than character, rectitude, dignity, a sense of what is right, responsible, decorous."
  </em>
</p>

<p>
I will dearly miss my father, and it is my hope that I one day become half the Mensch he was.

      "Everyone's actions are driven by the pursuit of the next state of mental comfort."
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  True selflessness is a very rare trait. What does one gain from going out of their way to help another? An intrinsic sense of fufilment is what at least I'm after when I do things that only benefit others, and there in lies the crux of this thought. While I'm not privy to anything tangible as a result of selflessness, the satisfaction I receive is payment. The mental comfort conjured by such actions can be equated to real world objects, gestures or actions. 
</p>
<p>
  So to re-visit the thought, mental comfort is what drives everyone. Mental comfort through money earned, family cared for, or even urges sated. A human's actions can be digressed back to mending the current lull in mental comfort.
