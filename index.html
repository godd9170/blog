          <p>I’ve nowhere near the sample size to start formulating laws, nor do I think you can just make up a law - however I feel like I’m on to something here. I’ve now had the (dis)pleasure of working on upwards of 10 different teams in a professional setting for more than a few months. Long enough for the honeymoon effect to end, and for a true assessment of the character of those surrounding me. Invariably some folks transcend a professional relationship, and some folks you tolerate only because you’re literally paid to do so. Once you’ve reached this state, you’re able to apply my law.</p>
<p>It’s a simple mental evaluation and can only truly be measured by yourself. All you need to do is find some time when you’re emotionally neutral (not worked up, or overly happy) and picture in your head someone, and ask yourself the following question. “Would you enjoy dining with them for breakfast?”. I’m talking a standard, greasy spoon, no occasion, weekday breakfast. Beginning what is otherwise a day filled with opportunity, a fresh sleep behind you and a world of ambition in your fingertips, with the company of this person and this person only. You don’t need to worry about peculiar social implications or optics, pretend this occurred naturally. Do not overthink it, take your first reaction to the thought and use that as the outcome of the assessment.</p>
<p>No changing. This is binary, ‘would enjoy/would not enjoy’. This test is horrendously biased and unfair if it were the deciding criteria for a job interview, but that’s not the case. I treat this like an exercise in my own personal mental health. Should I ever come to a point where I can’t honestly answer ‘would enjoy’ to a majority of my peers I know it’s time to make some moves. I’ll never be so naive to think that I can reach 100% on this evaluation, however it’s certainly worth striving for.</p>

          <p>Based on every psychological assessment I’ve done, and through surveying those close to me, I am an extrovert. The last time I went through Myers-Briggs I wasn’t just a little extroverted either, I was pushing the maxima. What does that even mean though? If you’re one to refer to wikipedia - which don’t kid yourself you are - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s me alright, if the interaction with ‘other people’ is one where its socially acceptable to begin speaking to a stranger (Networking event, bar, wedding etc.) or I’m previously acquainted, I am substantially happier than being alone. I think concentrating on social interaction and vocalizing my thoughts just helps me justify my decisions, which in turn allows me to enjoy them more. I seem to need another’s understanding of my day to day. Wikipedia goes on to claim that “[extraverts] tend to work well in groups”, which I suppose at least in my case is a function of that yearn for peer approval. </p>
<p>When I first learned about extraversion/introversion it was during grade school, a time where one’s social status among peers seemed to mean everything. Those regarded to be objectively superior were the popular. This then justified extraversion as objectively better than introversion. Literally speaking I know that no one side of the spectrum is superior to the other, but I can’t shake the negative connotation of ‘introvert’. It’s because of this association that I truly believe I introduced bias to the Myers-Briggs assessment.</p>
<p>I write this at the midpoint of a solo road trip up the west coast beginning in San Francisco, a trip that I felt I needed as an exercise in mental health. I have no real itinerary other than sleeping on the couches of a few friends along the way and a flight out of Vancouver 2 weeks from my arrival. This means each day I just make up as I go - without that whole affirmation from peers thing I mentioned earlier. So now what is the superior psyche? It would seem this is a situation where introverts reign supreme. </p>
<p>On day 1 I took to the streets of SF headed right for the Golden Gate bridge. No idea what I would do when I got there, but it at least provided me a direction. As I approached it, I noted that many shops offered a bicycle rental package that let you cycle over the bridge. I declined to enter each of them not wanting to advertise to the shop owners that I was by myself. Somehow I was convinced that it was too socially unacceptable to enjoy only the company of myself. Eventually however I talked myself into braving the pedantic ordeal I’d constructed and unsurprisingly what ensued was no social anguish whatsoever, a few nice conversations, and myself coasting happily across an American landmark. </p>
<p>My endeavours since have been increasingly less hesitant, I truly feel I’m reaching a new found inner self confidence and a lessened regard for the opinions of those around me. I’m starting to really enjoy my own introspection and look forward to long stretches of road by myself. I suppose this is me truly embracing the side of the spectrum I’d once looked down on.</p>

          <p>Try and think of the last really good conversation you had. What was it about that conversation that stood out? Was it a balance of speaking time from all involved parties, or did one member, perhaps yourself, do the bulk of the speaking? Was there a moment during the conversation that had you silently remarking how enjoyable it had been? Perhaps a moment where all parties agreed out loud that it was a strong exchange of words?</p>
<p>This is something I found myself musing about the other day after a chat with my colleague. He comes from the world of Sales, and has collected what he likes to call, “An array of Jedi mind tricks” throughout the years. His opinion, is that the strongest of conversationalists, have mastered the <em>Art of the Question</em>. Phrasing what you’re trying to convey to someone, in the form of a question allows them to discover your point from their perspective - that is of course, if its done properly. It almost gives you the questioner, a viewport into the cognition of the answering party and allows for a control over the engagement in a way that prepositions simply cannot. </p>
<p>I’m one to ramble. I used to try and answer my own questions as I was asking them, and enter a rabbit-hole of misguided self-banter until I received some form of acknowledgement from whoever was witnessing my monologue. I thought that to really ‘win’ a conversation was to provide the most best answers, as if somehow I’m to know what a person wants to hear without… well asking them.</p>
<p>For the last few weeks I’ve flipped the script. I now try to craft better, open ended questions that allow myself and whoever I’m talking to, to stay on track. The results have been rewarding. I find a lessened anxiety that I was accustomed to feeling whilst hunting for a statement during lulls in speaking. I find that my questions are more apt to push the conversation along. Most of all I find that the body language of my encounters tends to be more positive, and by that I mean I’m getting more agreement, and interest in what it is I’m saying.</p>
<p>So there it is, <em>The Art of the Question</em>. I was confused when it was first proposed to me, but I now truly regard it as one of the best business lessons I’ve had.</p>

	Another year, another park. Our Goddard time-honoured tradition of seeing an MLB game at every major league facility has come one check mark closer. Philadelphia was the target this year and one of the few 'drivable' destinations we've yet to see. George's 21st birthday had just passed, and I figured a baseball trip was a fitting gift. Here's where we're at for parks visited:
  </p>

  <div id="legend">
    <div class="indicator" style="background-color: green;"></div><span>Visited <strong>(14 + Montreal)</strong></span><br>
    <div class="indicator" style="background-color: red;"></div><span>Not Visited <strong>(16)</strong></span>
  </div>
  <div id="trip-information">
    <div id="logo-place"></div>
    <div id="text-data">
      <div id="park-name"></div>
      <div id="team-name"></div>
      <div id="visited"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="container1" style="position: relative; width: 100%; height:480px;"></div>

  <p>
   We watched the sub 500 Miami Marlins take on the bottom feeding Phillies for what promised to be a less than enthusiastic match up. The Phillies got off to an early lead and continued to punish the fish for the remainder of the evening. So much so, George and I decided that after good 7th inning stretch we depart for the bar.
  </p>

  <p>
  	The night escalated. Russell, a friend from Seattle now calls Philly home encouraged us to meet him at a nightclub mere blocks from the Liberty Bell. Several rounds of Jägermeister, a bridal party lap dance and a foggy return back to the AirBnB yielded myself separated from George. Then this happened:
  </p>
  <img src="/images/philly/key.JPG">
  <p>
  I could see George's shoes inside and promptly began to pound on the door to no avail. The apartment was on the second floor, and I remembered seeing a fence I could climb up onto the balcony. My arm got barked up by the fence, and my shoes ripped, but I had successfully mounted the balcony. Here I proceeded to rap rhythmically on the patio door with no signs of stirring. I figured it would eventually wake him, but that was when a window at the adjacent apartment shot open and a furious man informed me that he would, "Come the f%$# down there" should my attempts for entry not cease. My attempts for entry ceased. 
  </p>
  <p>
	George has no cell phone, I can't make any noise, and my key is lodged in the front door. Fortunately (I guess you'd call it that) there was a relatively comfortable patio chair, where I spent my final night in Philly. Once I finally woke George not a word was spoken, and we left for Canada in a sleep deprived, disgruntled fashion.
  </p>
  <p>
  Despite the steep denouement to the weekend, we deemed it a success. We'd carried the baseball trip torch, re-connected with a friend, and got a sign for the gazebo. Here's some more from the trip:

          <p>The ‘Lowest Vacancy Rates Toronto has seen in years’ has put me in a rather precarious spot. My sublet ended August 31st, and there exists no lodging for myself thus far, here on the 5th of September. I swear it’s not for a lack of trying as I began my hunt for accommodations back in July, albeit not as tenaciously as these last few days. </p>
<p>I’ve managed to get myself subscribed to a number of channels that promise a comprehensive listing of all places, Padmapper, Kijiji, Craigslist, Zumper, Realtor.ca, Condos.ca and with the help of some agents - MLS. I send about 10 emails a day, that were once a hopeful synopsis of myself, and a request to view, and now consist of an semi-defeated inquiry as to the vacancy of the unit. It seems I can’t just charm myself into housing, the 60% ‘Sorry property has been leased’ rate has beaten the humility out of me.</p>
<p>While I’ve not an exact figure, I have seen roughly 25 places in the last 15 days, sometimes meeting a realtor friend, sometimes a landlord, and occasionally a non-existant, no-response, waste of your time no-show. The viewings are typically single digit hours after listing, and precede themselves with the phrase ‘Several offers have already been made’. Plenty of times offers are made without even looking at the unit! My partner in crime, and prospective roommate Joe and I have learned not to feel any sort of excitement post viewing, as the odds are we’ll not even have the chance to submit an offer. </p>
<p>We once got as far as being conditionally accepted on an offer, meaning a deposit, first and last month’s rent and we would receive the keys. However this was back in the naive early days of September where we thought we could do better and pulled the plug on the deal. There have been some regrets since then.</p>
<p>There was another time, with 10 days remaining in August that we’d thought we found a deal too good to be true. $2200/mo for an 800ft^2 unit on Fort York road with 2 bathrooms and a parking spot. We were even more delighted to learn that only one other offer had been submitted. We even heard back from the landlord who was very interested in meeting us - so we obliged. Then came the kicker - A Tennant who still resided in the unit had been neglecting to pay rent for 5 months now and would not vacate. “However”, our potential landlord quipped, “We have a court date this Thursday and we’re sure we can get her to leave.” Well, that sounds like a pretty minor issue. Surely a void of a tenancy agreement such as FAILING TO PAY THE RENT FOR 5 MONTHS, would be easy to enforce. Well, as we learned the following Friday - no, no it isn’t. Justice doesn’t exist, and Joe and I are now viewing 5 living spaces daily batting the prospective renters who are also in a state of desperation.</p>
<p>I’ve managed to secure myself a bed at my previous sublet from a roommate who is out of town for the week, and come Friday I’ll lay my sheets down on a couch. There is a tremendous weight on me these days, and I yearn for the days where a long day at the office could be rounded off with a flop on a couch at an abode I call home. Until then, chin up I suppose - for I’ve got some emails to send.</p>

          <p>Well it’s now day 4 of my new job in Toronto, and that means its time for a sappy ‘New City’ post. If you’re not one to enjoy playful narrative around an otherwise extremely mediocre day, do yourself a favour and skip this one.</p>
<p>In my infinite wisdom, I decided it was best to start my first day from the comfort of my own bed in Prince Edward County. The plan was to hop in with my Toronto bound Uncle at quarter to six  and make it to the office for 9am - optimistic. Alas, I found myself shotgun heading west right on schedule. My Uncle Dan, a career musician, is always capable of directing the conversation to something interesting. After weighing in on Geopolitics, the Conflict in the Middle East and how much a lunch should cost, I’d arrived at my stop - Woodbine Station.</p>
<p>A more seasoned TTC traveller would probably grasp the idea of tokens being the currency of the system, however not this guy. I proudly presented a $5 bill to the less than enthused woman behind the kiosk guarding the turnstiles. “One Adult Please” I enthusiastically requested as my bill slid down the steel tray beneath the agent’s plexiglass encasing. Instead of the joyful affirmation I’d hoped to receive, I was instead given my initial offering right back. This had me a tad perturbed, but I concluded that the issue here was clearly one of volume. “One Adult Please!” I prodded once more. A queue of deflated Monday commuters had begun forming behind me at this point. This time I received some narrative with my rejection, “Change?” I was asked with a patronizing smirk. There was a pronounced lack of communication between myself and TTC’s least verbose employee. With a sharp annoyed gesture to the glass box to my left, I was able to deduce that some denomination of currency was to be deposited in the box before the turnstile would allow my patronage. “Oh!, I see - yes change please.” I said with a sense of enlightenment. Two loonies, a twoonie and four quarters were slid back to me. $3.25 was the value that shows on the fare matrix beneath ‘Adult’. It wasn’t until after I’d inserted the two loonies that I came to the sudden realization that I had just blown my opportunity to come to $3.25 is exact change with what I had to work with. Round Two - I slid the twoonie back to my increasingly unimpressed friend with a goofy smile to indicate I was in need of more change to meet the fare. The man queued behind me had enough of my incompetence and forced his token into the box and pushed his was past, followed by three or four others who were in a similar mindset. Welcome to Toronto.</p>

<p>
    One day, I hope I have an original idea for a blog post. I definitely approach them in full belief that I’m the first to postulate such a thought, yet a quick google shows it’s already a pretty discussed concept. I suppose with 7.4 billion living human brains out there, and millennia of written <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epistemology</a> it would be naive to think you are unique theory. Maybe one day.
</p>

<p>
With that meta thought said, I present to you my iPhone Sunday thought.
</p>


<div class="iphone-thought">
  <div class="metadata"><span class="label">Time:</span><span class="data"> July 9th 2015</span></div>

  <div class="thought-body">
    <span class="thought">
      "Feeling that you need to be heard, the ringing voice in your head urging you to talk just for the sake of being heard, is the origins of many useless conversations."
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
I’m sure you have encountered the type. Chiming in from the other side of the boardroom table on a topic that’s of no familiarity. Offering input that’s of no substance, completely irrelevant and delightfully vague. Not unlike a dodging politician who’s put into the position of providing some narrative to an inquiry that travels 10ft. over their head.
</p>

<p>
The remark will typically be met with silence while the parties scramble to acknowledge and return the conversation back to the substance that was building amongst education contributors.  A <em>polite rejection</em>, to summarize it I suppose. 
</p>

<p>
I’m not sure how I came across it, but one day whilst perusing Wikipedia I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. Check this out:
</p>

<p>
    <em>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias whereby relatively unskilled people suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is.</em>
</p>

<p>
Bingo! David Dunning and Justin Kruger have just <em>scienced</em> my observations. This iPhone thought is an obvious symptom. I firmly believe that an enormous amount of conference calls I’ve been a part of could be greatly narrowed down if such a condition wasn’t as prevalent. 
</p>

<p>
As if this isn’t already frustrating, the most inhibiting findings lie in the corollary. Those who may very well have an excellent input shy away to those who are simply more confident. So not only are the <em>illusory superior</em> injecting useless material, they're preventing those with productive input from contributing. 
</p>

<p>
So the key takeaway here is to be aware. By definition, if you’re aware you might be the one breathing hot air, you aren’t suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. Ask questions when you aren’t certain, and refrain from confidently speculating. It’s good to draw from experience, but make sure it’s relevant to the topic. Finally, if you’re one to control the conversation, make sure you call on those who might be silenced by the confident ineptitude in the room.

Well I did it. I abstained from consuming alcohol for the most consecutive days in a row since I was in Grade 11 <span style="font-size: 8px;">(Sorry Mom)</span>. I swear I thought of the idea myself, although as I learned while participating that it is very much already a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_January" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thing</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Oh well, this wasn't about originality, it was about proving to myself that I could do it. Drinking has become far too regular of an occurrence in my life, and I was curious to see if a lot of the things I blamed on my regular intoxication, were in fact as a result of that. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.dryjanuary.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DryJanuary.org.uk</a> claims the following 4 benefits from participating.
</p>

        <div class="dryjan-saving dryjan-icon"></div>
        <span class="benefit-subtext">Save loads of dosh!</span>
    </div>
</div>


<p>
Being an English organization, they've elected to call their fourth benefit <em>'Save loads of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dosh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dosh</a>!'</em>, which in Canadian means <em>Money</em>. all seem pretty logical, and as of today I can now confirm/deny whether they actually happen.
</p>

<h2 id="Health"><i class="dryjan-health"> Healthier inside and out</i></h2>
<p>
    Because I went into this challenge with a clean bill of health, there wasn't really anything I was looking to see improve physically. That being said, I'd noticed that days following long stretches of consumption typically offered a much poorer set of cognitive ability. My memory, my critical thinking and my general problem solving skills were frustratingly inhibited. 
</p>
<p>
    Up until about a week ago, I would have drawn the conclusion that such mental barriers were not as a result of my taste for alcohol. However this final week has changed my perception. I find that I'm able to recall more, quip back with witty material faster and come to a conclusion on the best way to tackle a daily obstacle in a more logical manner. What's more is I find myself to be more calm and tactical in my behaviour.
</p>

<h2 id="Weight"><i class="dryjan-weight"> Weight Loss</i></h2>
<p>
    This is the category that unfortunately misses it's mark the most. Just this last weekend (Jan 29th) I was joking about how I'd actually only lost a single pound. It seemed that there was no correlation to weight loss whatsoever, yet this morning atop a mechanical scale at the local gym, I literally stood corrected. It would seem that in the final week I had lost a total of 7 pounds. Which bearing in mind that no other changes had been made to my daily routine, is pretty sweet! 
</p>

<h2 id="Sleep"><i class="dryjan-sleep"> Improved Sleep</i></h2>
<p>
    Oh yeah. Dry January is the answer to all my insomniatic cries for help. To be fair I'm exaggerating, I usually sleep decently, however this last month has been what bedtime should always be like. I'm not waking in the middle of the night nearly as much as months previous, nor am I struggling to fall asleep as much. I still find leaving the confines of my mattress difficult in the AM, but throughout the day I'm not catching myself yawning, or thinking of naps. 
</p>

<h2 id="Dosh!"><i class="dryjan-saving"> Save loads of dosh!</i></h2>

<p>
    The dosh in my bank account is higher than I anticipated! Thanks to <a href="https://www.mint.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mint.com</a> I've got the numbers to illustrate that. Below is my monthly spending on Alcohol and Bars. 
</p>

<img src="/images/alcoholspending.png">

<p>
    Sure, December brings with it all the time off and excessive consumption, but even still literally an order of magnitude less I spent during dry January. It's actually a bit unsettling how much cash each month gets filtered through your kidneys. 
</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    So there you have it. Dry January is a wonderful exercise after all. I'm a sharper, lighter, richer and generally more awake person as a result of it. Granted the key takeaway is that 'dosh' aside, most of the benefits don't manifest themselves until the last week or so. Which begs the question, "Do I continue into February and see if the benefits only increase with time?". I don't know I can't think straight right now, I suppose I'll mull it over this $7.50 Weiss beer.
